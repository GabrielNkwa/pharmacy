        In line with one of the components of Primary Healthcare and as
        enshrined in the sustainable development goal, target 3.8, ‘Provision of
        essential medicines’ Pharmaceutical Market Access Initiative and
        Development (Pharma-AID Africa) on the 24th of August, 2023 was at Karmo
        Sabo Primary Health Care Centre located at a suburb of the Federal
        Capital Territory to give support to the facility. The visit was in
        pursuance of the mission of Pharma-Aid Africa ‘enabling access’
        overcoming barrier to patient access to medicines by closing the gap in
        the last mile pharmaceutical supply chain of primary and selected
        secondary healthcare centres in Nigeria and Africa at large. A
        representative of the Director of Pharmacy, FCT Primary Healthcare
        Board, Pharm Abdul was at the site to take delivery of the medicines. He
        expressed his appreciation for the donation saying that the healthcare
        centre will benefit immensely from it as it will go a long way to cater
        for the needs of the residents that troop to the centre on daily basis.
        The Executive Director of Pharma-AID Africa, Dr. Chinedu Ayogu while
        handling over the medicine tasked the centre to make judicious use of
        the items. A member of the Board of Advisors, Pharma-AID Africa who is
        also the Executive Secretary, Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Group of
        Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Pharm Frank Muonemeh in his speech
        pointed out that outside the drug donation, that Pharma-AID Africa was
        at the site to identify other areas that may require collaboration.
        Others present at the occasion were the OIC of the facility, Mr.
        Ibrahim, Pharm Pamela Chiazo- Senior Procurement Expert Liberia and
        other health workers and members of Pharma-AID Africa.
